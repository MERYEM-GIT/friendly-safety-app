Project Title: Friendly Safety App 

Project Description:
Friendly Safety App is a kid-friendly safety chatbot that helps children practice responding to uncomfortable or unsafe situations. The app uses simple language, 
large buttons, and clear choices, allowing younger users to understand what to do if they feel unsafe, are being bullied, or are dealing with strangers or online risks.
Everything runs in the browser, and no personal data is stored. The goal is to give kids a safe space to think through “What should I do?” before something happens in real life.

How to Use the App:
1. Open the app in your browser (using the link provided in my Congressional App Challenge submission or by opening the `index.html` file).
2. Choose a situation or question from the options (for example: strangers, bullying, feeling unsafe, online issues).
3. Use the quick-reply buttons to pick your answer instead of typing, so it’s easier for kids to use.
4. The app will respond with:
   - Safe choices
   - What to do next
   - When to get help from a trusted adult
6. You can restart or pick a different situation at any time.
